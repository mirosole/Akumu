## 🎭 Description

*Akumu* is a 3D first-person horror game where the player must escape an office filled with paranormal phenomena.

👨‍💼 **The main character** is an office worker in Tokyo who stayed late at work. Suddenly, objects begin to move on their own and the doors no longer open. Realizing something terrifying is happening, he tries to escape — but a **Yokai**, an ancient spirit, begins to hunt him.

---

## 🎮 Gameplay

The player must:
✅ **Solve puzzles** and mini-games (e.g., finding codes, connecting wires)
✅ **Interact with objects** (collect keys, documents, access cards)
✅ **Hide from the Yokai** in lockers, behind furniture, or under tables
✅ **Explore two floors** of a mysterious and dangerous office
✅ **Use checkpoints** to save progress
✅ **Survive surreal mechanics** like the endless staircase

## 👁️ Main Threats

👻 **Yokai** — hunts the player, reacting to sound and movement. If it sees where you hide, you’re doomed.
💀 **Screamers** — unexpected scary moments that jump out when you least expect them.
